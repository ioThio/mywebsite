    <h1>My background</h1>
    <p>I come from Athens,Greece where the sea is clear and the sun is always shinning.
      As a teenager I developed a passion about Astrophysics and decided to follow Physics studies.
      But Art also inspired me a lot,so I studied classic guitar and created my own drawings.
      After I got my Bachelor's and learned a whole bunch of stuff about laws of Physics, Stars, Galaxies and the Universe,
I discovered the world of Web Development and got really excited. I can combine Science and Art to create beautiful things.
I constantly seek inspiration and I' m very passionate about the projects I' m involed in.   </p>
